### Erebus Light tmTheme

A [TextMate][1] _(and [Sublime Text][2])_ theme based on [Monokai][3] by [Wimer Hazenberg][4].

Erebus Light is an edit of [Erebus][5] which is a warm theme with an autumn'ish feel. Mainly tested for use with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but should work fine with most languages.

___Note__: this theme was only tested in [Sublime Text][2]. It should be fully compatible with [TextMate][1], but if you come across any errors, please report them and I'll do my best to fix them._
